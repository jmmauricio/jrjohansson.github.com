<h1>QDpack example - Coupled qubits</h1>

<p>
This document describes how to use the QD package to calculate the dynamics of a simple quantum system. The example is a
system of two coupled qubits that are initially in their ground states. An RF field is applied to the first qubit which
gradually excite it (Rabi oscillations). The static interaction between the qubits cause energy exchange between the
qubit once energy is pumped into the first qubit via the RF field. The example program is configured to output the 
occupation probabilities for each qubit. 
</p>

<h2>Model and parameter values</h2>

<p>
The model and parameter values used in this example are the following:

<h2>Example source code</h3>

<p>
The example programs source code is available for download  <a href="http://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/jrjohansson/web/files/run_qubits.c">here</a>, and it is also
available in the QDpack source code distribution.
</p>

<h2>Program structure</h2>

<ul>
	<li>	
	First the parameters for the Hamiltonian is configured by initializing a data structure of the type
	"solver_param".
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Next, a Hamiltonian is set up (either a new Hamiltonian is implemented, or one from the QDpack library
	is used).
	</li>

	<li>
	The quantum system data structure is created and initialized, i.e., the number of quantum levels in
	each subsystem is configured.
	</li>

	<li>
	Dissipation is configured: A list of operators and rates that appear in the master equation (OPTIONAL).
	</li>

	<li>
	Initial state is configured.
	</li>

	<li>
	Finally, the solver is called. For each time-step the solver call a callback function where application
	specific processing of the density matrix at time t (extraction of occupation probabilites, calculation
	of expectation values, etc.) is be done.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Build and run</h2>

<p>
Build the example by typing "make run_qubits" in the QDpack directory. This will produce a executable file called
"run_qubits". Run this program from the same directory, after making sure that the data output directory (data/qubit.dynamics)
exists:
</p>

<pre>
$ mkdir -p data/qubit.dynamics
$ time ./run_qubits
Quantum system with 2 sub systems: 2 2
DEBUG: combining (tensor product)
DEBUG: combining (tensor product)
DEBUG: starting dm_evolve_lme_t (Lindblad-type Master Eqaution)

real    0m1.078s
user    0m0.972s
sys     0m0.108s
$
</pre>

<p>
The program output is stored in the directory <b>data/qubit.dynamics/</b>:
</p>

<pre>
$ wc data/qubit.dynamics/*

$
</pre>

<p>
The occupation probabilities of each qubit is stored in individual files with and integer identifier in the file name. The
data is formatted in the tab-separated values (TSV) ascii format, and column one to three is: 1) time, 2) probability to be in the
ground state, and 3) probability of being in the excited state, respectively"

<h2>Plotting results</h2>

<p>
Plotting the results for the occupation probabilities for the three qubis gives the following figures:

Figure caption: Left (top), the occupation probabilities of the first qubit. Fast oscillations are Rabi oscillations due
to the RF driving. Slow oscillations are due to the static interaction with the second qubit. Right (bottom), the occupation
probabilities of the second qubit. The oscillations are due to interaction with the first qubit. The gradual decay
of oscillation visibility is due to dissipation in the second qubit (first qubit is dissipationless in this simulation).
